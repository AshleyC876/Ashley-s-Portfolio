<h1>About Me</h1>

<p>Hello! I'm Ashley Chambers, an international student from Jamaica <br>
  pursuing my passion for technology at Voorhees University—an HBCU <br>(Historically
   Black Colleges and Universities).  Currently on track to<br>graduate in May 2026,
   I am majoring in Computer Science with a keen focus<br> on becoming a proficient software 
   developer, specializing in front-end <br> development and UX/UI design.</p>

<p>My journey in the world of technology is driven by a deep-seated
   passion<br> for bringing designs to life through code. I believe 
   that the intersection<br> of technology and creativity is
    where innovation thrives. I aspire to create<br> seamless 
    and visually captivating user experiences that not only meet but<br>
     exceed expectations.</p>

<p>Join me on this exciting journey as I explore the boundless opportunities<br> that technology has to offer. 
  Together, let's create a future where technology<br> is not just functional but also a work of art.
 Thank you for visiting my corner<br> of the web—where ideas come to life through code!
